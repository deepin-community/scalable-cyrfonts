scalable-cyrfonts (4.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use maintscript support in dh_installdeb rather than writing out
    dpkg-maintscript-helper commands by hand.  We now simply Pre-Depend on
    a new enough version of dpkg rather than using
    'dpkg-maintscript-helper supports' guards, leading to more predictable
    behaviour on upgrades.  Patch provided by Colin Watson, closes: #659741.

scalable-cyrfonts (4.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Place the fonts in new X.org directories.  This was not urgent for
    these packages, but at last: thanks to Joey Hess, 
    closes: #362335, #362336, #362333.
  * Updated standards version (3.6.6.2).

scalable-cyrfonts (4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "tex --ini" instead of initex and "tex" instead of "virtex"
    because the new tetex-bin from experimental lacks "virtex" and
    "initex" (see #329972).
  * Include two versions of the T2 package in the source package and use
    cyrfinst from them insted of the version of cyrfinst from tetex-src -
    one of the versions is for use with the older fontinst and another for
    use with the newer.  Remove build-dependency on tetex-src.  This
    closes: #322433, thanks to Frank Küster.
  * Register the fonts acording to the TeX package policy.  This makes
    unnecessary for the user to edit the configuration files in /etc/texmf
    in order to use this package.  Thanks to Andrey Kiselev,
    closes: #312916.
  * Generate TeX fonts for OT2 encoding also.  Thanks to Joerg Friedrich,
    closes: #296455.
  * Check for the existence of /etc/fonts/fonts.conf in t1-*.postinst.
    Thanks to Nikita Youshchenko, closes: #303695.

    closes: #281726.
      - integrated Serbian glyphs by Danilo Segan, thanks to Stefan
        Baums, closes: #275214;
      - fixed some Russian Cyrillic glyphs and width in NumbusMono (Free
        Courier); 
      - fixed bug that brokes printing from Qt;
      - added vietnamese glyphs by The Thanh Han;
      - applied Mashrab changes/additions for Uzbek, Tajik and other Asian
        Cyrillic alphabets;
      - fixed glyph names on Chancery so that Macedonian glyphs are in
        place now (by Damjan);
      - wided germandbls in NimbusSansReg/Obli (Free Helvetian).
      - fixed fi/fl ligatures (separated back as suggested by Ralf
        Stubner.  I hope this closes: #237425, thanks to Victor Porton.
  * Do not patch the URW fonts for Serbian glyphs - the patch is applied
    upstream
  * Correct the description of the scalable-cyrfonts-tex package.
    Describe the relations between this package and t1-cyrillic, t1-teams
    and t1-oldslavic.  Add suggests to these packages.  Thanks to Andreas
    Metzler, closes: #284212.
  * Update the copyright file.
  * Rename the font file names to keep them same as in the previous
    version.  Due to limitations of Defoma the font file name may not
    change.

  * s/pfaedit/fontforge/g.  Thanks to Daniel Schepler, closes: #250467.
  * Removed README.font_chages
  * scalable-cyrfonts-tex.README.Debian: write that for unknown reason the
    DVI viewers don't see the fonts.  The users have to convert the DVI
    files to postscript or use pdftex/pdflatex.

scalable-cyrfonts (4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Serbian glyphs to the URW-based fonts.  Patch provided by Danilo
    Segan.  Thanks to Frank Murphy, closes: #230840.
  * Add stressed Cyrillic letter I to the fonts that miss it but have
    regular Cyrillic letter I and grave.  Thanks to Alexander Shopov,
    closes: #178399.
  * The fonts were registered to defoma with wrong paths.  Now they are
    moved from /usr/share/fonts/type1/t1-{cyrillic,teams,oldslavic} to
    /usr/share/fonts/type1/{cyrillic,teams,oldslavic}.  This fixes the
    broken links in /var/lib/defoma. 
  * New target in debian/rules to create tar.gz package with the fonts.
    The fonts in Debian differ from upstream and it makes sence to
    create a package for non-Debian users.  I added also a target for zip
    package with fonts for MS Windows.  Add build-depends on zip and
    sysutils (for /usr/bin/todos).

scalable-cyrfonts (4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The location of the default texmf.cnf file in recent Debian TeX
    packages changed from /etc/texmf to /var/lib/texmf/web2c, hence
    the value of TEXMFCNF in fontinst/Makefile should be changed.  Bun in
    order to avoid future problems in case that the location of
    texmf.cnf again changes I decided to include some example texmf.cnf in
    fontinst/texmf.cnf.  Now scalable-cyrfonts doesn't depend on the
    Debian system texmf.cnf during its compilation.  Thanks to Daniel
    Schepler (closes: #209017).

scalable-cyrfonts (4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New binary packages to follow the usual in Debian font package
    naming policy (fontformat-family).  The old scalable-cyrfonts is
    replaced by t1-cyrillic, t1-teams and t1-oldslavic.
  * The old scalable-cyrfonts-x11 is removed.  For now the font
    packages depend on xutils because I don't want to double them (as
    the packages gsfonts and gsfonts-x11).  In future this dependency can
    be removed when the postinst of xutils cares to update the Type1 font
    directory by itself or some package symilar to x-ttcidfont-conf is
    used. 
  * The fontnames are changed in order to avoid possible trademark
    infringements as this was suggested in debian-legal.  The word
    `Free' ensures uniqueness of our names and the other part of the
    names are English words (which ensures they are not registered).
  * New upstream release of the URW fonts.  The new Courier fonts
    (packaged as `Free Courier') have `isFixedPitch true' in their
    FontInfo dictionary.  Thanks to Juliusz Chroboczek (closes: #177917).
  * The source package contains .sfd rather than .pfb fonts.  They are
    automaticaly converted to .pfb format by pfaedit.
  * Type1 fonts preserve their original encoding.  In former packages they
    were reencoded to cp1251 because StarOffice 5.1 needed such encoding.
  * Fixed non-existing font in fonts.alias of the former package
    scalable-cyrfonts-x11. 
  * The build dependencies are properly classified into Build-Depends
    and Build-Depends-Indep.  Thanks to Junichi Uekawa (closes: #158349).
  * The TeX support is on different princible.  Now there is much better
    support for the latin TeX encodings (OT1 and T1).
  * The family of the narrowed versions of Helvetian is `Free Helvetian
    Condensed' instead of `Free Helvetian' with width `condensed'.  This
    is so because many applications seam to ignore fonts with width !=
    normal when fonts with width == normal are present. 
  * postinst and postrm of t1-* invoke xftcache and fc-cache if present.
  * Updated `Standards-Version': 3.5.10.

scalable-cyrfonts (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed GSFONTS and RELATIVE_GSFONTS because the fonts in gsfonts

  * scalable-cyrfonts-x11: Times, Helvetica and Courier are not provided
    via fonts.alias but in fonts.{dir,scale}.
  * scalable-cyrfonts-x11: Helvetica and Courier have oblique variants but
    not italic and Times has only italic but not oblique.
  * PFB fonts instead of PFA.
  * scalable-cyrfonts conflicts with older versions of
    scalable-cyrfonts-{x11,tex}.  scalable-cyrfonts-{x11,tex} require the
    same version of scalable-cyrfonts.
  * Symlinks of AFM files are added in scalable-cyrfonts-x11.
