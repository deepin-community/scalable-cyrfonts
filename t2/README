This is the file README of the T2 package.

T2 package is Copyright 1997-1999 Werner Lemberg, Vladimir Volovich
and any individual authors listed elsewhere in package files.

It may be distributed under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public
License, either version 1.1 of this license or (at your option) any
later version.  The latest version of this license is in
   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
version 1999/06/01 or later.

The `T2' package is available at

	CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/t2
	ftp://ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex/t2-current.tar.gz

Starting with the 1998/12/01 release, LaTeX2e officially supports new
standard Cyrillic font encodings (T2A, T2B, T2C, X2) and various
Cyrillic input encodings, which form the `cyrillic' bundle of the
official LaTeX distribution (CTAN:macros/latex/required/cyrillic).
Installation procedure is described in the file `00readme.txt' which
is part of the `cyrillic' bundle. Note: the `cyrillic' bundle will not
work with LaTeX2e releases older than 1998/12/01.

Starting with the version 3.6k, BABEL system officially supports T2
encodings.  You can get the distribution at

	CTAN:macros/latex/required/babel

The installation and usage of Cyrillic in LaTeX are also described in
the file `cyrguide.tex' which is part of the base LaTeX2e
distribution. In particular, in addition to the `cyrillic' bundle you
will need at least LH fonts and hyphenation patterns.

The latest version of the LH fonts package (v3.20) which supports T2A,
T2B, T2C, X2 standard Cyrillic TeX font encodings (and also LCY, OT2,
and some other encodings) is available at

	CTAN:fonts/cyrillic/lh
	http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/cyrtug/files/cyremtex.98
	http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/cyrtug/eng/news.htm
	ftp://ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex/lhfnt-3.20.tar.gz

You can find a collection of Russian hyphenation patterns which
support T2 (and other) font encodings in a `ruhyphen' package at

	CTAN:language/hyphenation/ruhyphen
	ftp://ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex/ruhyphen.tar.gz

Some additional support files and packages are located in
subdirectories of the `T2' package.

* the `mathtext' package which makes it possible to use Cyrillic
  letters `transparently' in math formulae. To generate the package file
  `mathtext.sty', run the command "latex mathtext.ins". The package
  supports an option `warn', which will produce warning messages in case
  of using Cyrillic letters in math formulae. Load this package _before_
  babel and/or fontenc.

* the package `citehack.sty' redefines some of the LaTeX commands in
  order to make it possible to use Cyrillic letters as arguments of
  \cite and \bibitem commands (it is not specific to Cyrillic; the same
  problems would arise if one will try to use characters defined via the
  inputenc package as labels or notes of \cite and \bibitem commands).
  It also makes it possible to use inputenc-generated characters in
  \label and \ref arguments.

  This is a temporary hack.  Hopefully, the corresponding commands will
  be corrected in the next release of LaTeX2e.

* read a `README' file in the `etc/rubibtex' directory if you are
  using bibtex.

* read a `README' file in the `etc/rumkidx' directory if you are using
  makeindex.

* the directory `examples' contains some examples which demonstrate
  usage of Cyrillic packages. In particular, the `example1.tex' contains
  examples of using different Cyrillic font encodings and input
  encodings in LaTeX.

* read a `README' file in the `cyrplain' directory if you would like
  to use Cyrillic in Plain TeX based macro-packages.

* the `cyrfinst' directory contains Cyrillic support for fontinst
  package.

* the `enc-maps' directory contains various mappings for charsets and
  encodings.

There are mailing lists devoted to problems of Cyrillic and
multilingual TeX and T2 encodings, where you can try to get support on
setting up and using Cyrillic packages with TeX & friends.
